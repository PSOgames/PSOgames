- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PSOgames
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in create games
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning unity and unreal engine 5

Hello! My name is Patrick, I have created a game in java, I am learning unity and unreal engine 5. Actually I work as web developer and my dream is become a game developer.
I love games, and I love the process to create that. I love to feel like a god, like a creator of something, some universe, creature and everything else.

I learned java and I had difficult to learn, but when I finished the web developer fullstack course my mind opened and I see that I can understand others progaming languages.
I am going to start a game made in unity.
